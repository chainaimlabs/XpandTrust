# XpandTrust

Recursive low latency proof generation for institutional defi compliance using ZK Expander and GKR technology.

We are at the crux of Institutional Defi and Tokenization.

## Institutional Defi Workflows need layers of protocol level Trust

                 For Deeply Composed Compliance of
    		              Identity. Process. Risk. etc

- ### Emerging Institutional Defi Needs Layers of Compliance - WITHOUT compromising Privacy / Business Sensitivity.

- ### Needs effective integration with Web 2 technologies to provide ZK-Oracles.

- ### Need Efficient ZK Provers for low latency proof / verification
  


## Project Structure

- **/xpander** - frontend implementation including custom oracle
- **/ecc2** - circuit created for compliance data verification ( a recurrsive structure for compilance ) . Provides multi-level compliance giving genuinenes of borrowers to the financial protocols via off-chain verification service, with a minimal and predictable on-chain footprint, incorporating many other parameters of the borrowers based on their business operations , supply chain relationships etc, that can be brought on-chain closer to web2 experience and web2 systems integrations. 

Other files not included are Expander which is used to serve localhost:3030 for prove and verification endpoint

# Solution:

## XpandTrust is a protocol level Recursion solution for ZK-RWA based on business standards( real-world apis )

- in Expander Technology
- is an enhanced re-implementation of a ZK-Snark solution that was a winner in the
  in ZK Hack Montreal in Aug 2024,

## In this boot camp, we have tried to enhance our implementation, by trying out one part of our

SCF-RWA project (on a MINA grant), with keyless technology from APTOS, and also get the Proof / Verification times
reduced. The implementation we are trying is the Multi-level Recursive Compliance in Supply Chain Finance


Effective Web 3 Digitization needs more than a high-level hash of data but layers of
Deep composition with MINIMAL Proof Generation and Verification footprint for Privacy-Protected
Business-sensitive information.

This is a Key Enabler for MSME Trade Finance Inclusivity.
Enables key processes like Supply Chain Finance.The intent of that project is to functionally prove the veracity and accommodating the and privacy and business sensitivity needs of real-world use-cases that have to be bridged between web2 and web3.


The current project Chainaim is working on is a a grant from MINA foundation, is a ZK-Snark based implementation in MINA extends in to many layers for proving business processes, bringing in standards for bpmn2.0, GS1, risk models and financial / compliance for institutional defi for compliance overarching tradfi and defi.
We are making very good progress in this area in our current MINA ZK project.
The one area of improvement for our solution could be in enhancing the web2 user experience and reducing the latency in Proof  and verification times. We also strongly feel for a wide variety of things we have been working, another layer of light weight proofs could be effective to bring a minimal footprint on-chain, while actually leveraging deep proofs that can be potentially leveraged from the MINA snark based solution, both onchain and offchain. We also have formed many relationships with many RWA standards efforts, and assembling them efficiently off-chain for a minimal and predictable proof sizes.

That is why we are very interested in the Expander family of proof systems. We have been trying to get 1 part of the solution tested out with keyless and GKR recursion, because our use-cases truely need those recursive forms of proofs. 

Beyond the hackathon, It is our aim and goal to explore how to use expander and keyless in to advancing our ZKP /ZKML usecases in this area. It would be really great if there are such opportunities to continue to build and collaborate.
uild and collaborate.
